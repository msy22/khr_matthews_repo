#  | IMPORTANT NOTE: The .yaml files in the "map_nav_params" folder are   |
#  |                 supposed to be used with an instance of the          |
#  |                 move_base node that is launched directly after the   |
#  |                 gmapping node. This is so gmapping can create a map  |
#  |                 which the move_base node can then navigate within.   |
#  |                 Otherwise, the move_base will simply use laser and   |
#  |                 odometry data to avoid obstacles between it and it's |
#  |                 current move goal... without creating or storing a   |
#  |                 map of any kind                                      |
